### Overall pipeline

1. Repeat and check the question, input, output, sample and cornor cases with interviewer.
Can write some key info on the board

2. Give one brute force idea
Of course you are not looking for this brute force implementation. OK, this can be optimized by

3. Optimize the idea, write the data structure, algorithm, time and space complexity
Should I start implement it in code, or you want me to conitnue to optimize it?

4. Check some test cases after finished the code and tell the interviewer result.

Sorry I will keep the variable names short just for convenience. In real code I will sure use more descriptive names

question for interviewer

1. How come this position is available?
2. What is a typical day of this position?
